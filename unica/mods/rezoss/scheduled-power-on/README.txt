Power schedule for dm3q / SM-S918B
==================================

UN1CA Settings > Power schedule, immediately below Battery Saving and above
Advanced GPU Tuning (Konabess). The scheduler remains a small platform-signed,
system-UID ROM package under mods/rezoss; it no longer has a launcher icon.
Its activity requires REBOOT permission to open. Its alarm/boot receiver is
not exported. The Settings menu is hidden if this mod or its Rezoss parent is
disabled, or the build target is not dm3q.

User controls
-------------
Select Power on, then choose:
  Save and Shutdown Now
  Save and I'll shutdown manually
The first option asks for final confirmation, saves the hardware power-on
request durably, and invokes Android's normal shutdown API. Any failure before
that point prevents the shutdown request. No root-manager or shell is used.

Enable Separate power-off and power-on times to select two dates/times and
Save schedule. Power off must be at least 5 minutes ahead; power on must be
at least 3 minutes after power off and no more than 7 days from saving.
All schedules are ONE-TIME. The confirmation shows both selected times.
Cancel automatic power off keeps the power-on alarm. Cancel entire schedule
also sends Samsung's cancellation command. Opening the page or changing a
picker never arms an alarm until the user chooses a save action.

Manual power-on times also require at least 5 minutes from the current clock.
Past dates cannot be selected. Time pickers start at the current time plus
5 minutes, rounded UP to a whole minute; separate power on starts no earlier
than 3 minutes after its power-off time. The picker displays the current clock
and earliest allowed time, disables OK for invalid selections, and checks again
when OK is pressed. Saving revalidates against the current clock before changing
any saved schedule or hardware alarm. Editing power off moves an earlier draft
power-on time forward to maintain the 3-minute gap; this does not change the
active schedule until Save. Existing saved events retain their original
two-minute restoration/driver margin, so an upcoming working schedule is not
discarded merely because it is now less than 5 minutes away.

The screen uses rounded cards, larger row labels, day/night colors and the
same UN1CA Settings wallpaper/transparency keys as Battery Saving. The design
reference is out/archived/example_UI.jpg. It uses the user's wallpaper rather
than copying the wallpaper shown in that reference. Editing a draft or changing
the separate-times switch takes effect only after saving.

Runtime behavior
----------------
Android AlarmManager delivers a one-shot exact ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP event
for the selected power-off time. There is no permanent background service or
polling loop. A short receiver worker holds a bounded wake lock while handling
an event. A generation token rejects obsolete deliveries; a consumed event is
persisted before requesting shutdown. A fresh Samsung power-on command must
succeed before any scheduled shutdown is requested.

An event arriving early, over 60 seconds late, with an uncertain save, with a
changed RTC offset, or with under 2 minutes remaining until power on is skipped.
A reboot or date/time change rearms future events, but never catches up a missed
shutdown. A power-off time less than 2 minutes away at restoration is skipped.
The times represent absolute instants; a timezone change changes their displayed
local equivalent. Device-protected private state allows restoration before
first unlock. The old app's credential-protected schedule is migrated when the
new Settings screen is first opened. First-unlock PIN requirements are unchanged.

Driver contract
---------------
Native code and the validated Samsung command format are unchanged:
Validated sec_pon_alarm.ko SHA-256 values (both accepted by integrate.sh):
9949d2045d979e8f25d0f84d7bffe2364263195e227155d2364e570bf29a31d6
c187518e90a9bddd8d9a87c635970ba5cf35728ad90e47ae72980c2f2360fb10 (S918BXXUAGZIF)
Command 0x400e6107 (_IOW('a',7,char[14])) accepts ASCII:
  1YYYYMMDDHHMM followed by NUL: enable using a UTC calendar date
  0202002010101 followed by NUL: cancel
The driver converts wall-clock time into RTC time and reserves its low two
bits for alarm mode. Do not perform the conversion twice. Cancellation queues
Samsung's reserved RTC date 2020-02-01 01:01:04.

pmic_rtc_setalarm stores pwron_alarm in RAM; pm8xxx_rtc_shutdown applies that
saved alarm during shutdown. RTC_WKALM_RD reads a different live alarm and
cannot verify the pending power-on request. Some driver/persistence failures
are suppressed by the ioctl; command acceptance is not independent readback
proof. The original scheduled startup was reported working by the user. The
new automatic shutdown and boot/clock restoration need device testing.

S918BXXUAGZIF static ABI revalidation (2026-10-19):
pon_alarm_ioctl at 0x1013e4 accepts (cmd & 0xffffff0f) == 0x400e6107.
Its specialized _copy_from_user copies 14 bytes; strlcpy uses a 14-byte
buffer, and ASCII fields remain mode/year/month/day/hour/minute. Mode '1'
enables the same wall-clock-to-RTC conversion and clears the low two bits;
mode '0' selects the same reserved cancellation date. The handler still calls
pmic_rtc_setalarm and sec_param_set(5, ...), suppressing their failures.
This validates the app-facing ABI, not the downstream RTC shutdown driver
or physical power-on behavior. No driver or app code changes were required.

Build and verification
----------------------
The existing Rezoss customize.sh sources integrate.sh. The APK is compiled
from Java/JNI and signed with the build's aosp/unica platform certificate.
Build defaults: Android SDK 37, build tools 37.0.0, NDK 28.2.13676358.
Native library loading is supported by the installed lib/arm64 directory.
Existing SELinux rules are unchanged: Samsung ioctl 0x6107 plus read-only RTC
ioctl 0x7009 for system_app. This applies to other system_app domain processes
as well. No raw RTC writes, sys.powerctl access, framework smali changes, or
shell/root permissions are added. REBOOT, USE_EXACT_ALARM, WAKE_LOCK and
RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED are declared by the package for its new functions.

From the repository root:
  bash unica/mods/rezoss/scheduled-power-on/tests/run.sh
  source buildenv.sh dm3q
  bash unica/mods/rezoss/scheduled-power-on/build.sh /tmp/PowerSchedule-new.apk
  bash unica/mods/rezoss/scheduled-power-on/tests/integration_test.sh
  bash -n unica/mods/settings/customize.sh
  git diff --check

Output APK paths must not already exist. Host schedule tests inject fake
hardware, timers, storage and shutdown operations. They cover save ordering,
permission/storage/driver failures, delayed and stale deliveries, replay,
cancellation, clock changes and missed events. UI integration tests verify
menu order, intent/resources, component protection and disabled-mod behavior.
No test installs anything on the phone, arms a real alarm or requests shutdown.

Rebuild/flash both Settings and the scheduler package to expose the new menu.
This change is not a live-device installation. Keep sufficient battery charge
for power on; shut down only after saving the intended schedule.
